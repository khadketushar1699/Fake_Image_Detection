# Fake Image Detection :
We created a model that classify the image using Convolutional Neural Network which is a deep learning model and help the user to identify whether it is a fake image or a real image. Also we used pretrained model that is VGG16 for the accuracy purpose. Used libraries are os,cv2,numpy,matplotlib,keras,sklearn and tensorflow in our project. Aims to develop a deep learning-based system that can detect fake images and prevent the spread of misinformation
